I've spent the last day or so exploring a coding challenge site that I've happened upon: <a href="http://www.talentbuddy.co" />Talentbuddy</a>.

Talentbuddy consists of a bunch of categories, each containing five or six challenges, such as sorting a list of test results, or predicting the increase in visitors to a site over a given number of weeks. Solutions can be entered in a choice of fourteen languages, from C to Python to Clojure. Code is entered directly into an editor in the browser, which supports syntax highlighting, parenthesis matching and so on Pretty nicely.

Once a solution has been entered it is checked. If it passes you get some experience points. If it doesn't you get the output, including compiler errors. One thing I quite like is that once I've passed a challenge in, say, Python, I can come back and do it in C and both solutions are saved.

After clearing a challenge, you can choose to post it for code review. Selecting to do this makes your code viewable by other people who have completed the challenge, and they can leave comments or rate your solution as "Smart" or "Readable". After that you can view and review solutions that others have come up with.

I do <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataCatalogue">katas</a> quite a bit when I want to do some coding but don't want to work on a particular project, and I won't stop doing them, but I do think that there is room for sites such as this. It's nice to get instant feedback and a record kept of which challenges have been completed and in which language. On the downside, the only thing that matters when submitting solutions here is the output. Practicing clean code and TDD, for instance, seems to be less of a focus.
