Over the next few weeks/months, I've decided to study the Gang of Four's 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">Design Patterns</a> book. It is the seminal work on Design 
Patterns, which Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern">describes</a> as being 
"...a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context". 

The book is recommended reading for all serious software developers, and I have owned a copy for years. While I am 
familiar with a good deal of the patterns the book describes, I've never taken the time to really go through the book
in order to develop a truly deep understanding of the patterns. 

I have used some of the patterns many times in the wild, and haven't used some of them at all, so there will be a nice 
mixed bag of old and new. I'll be working through the patters in chapter order, from Abstract Factory through to 
Visitor. For each pattern I will make a short post here about the pattern and post some sample Java code to my
 <a href="https://github.com/jeroanan/Patterns">Patterns</a> repo. I've chosen Java over my more regular Python because
 I think that its strong typing will illustrate how the patterns hang together better.
 
 The first couple of chapters in the book are an introduction and a case study that showcases various patters. While
 these are very important chapters to read I'll be skipping them here and instead I'll just jump straight into the
 Abstract Factory pattern.
