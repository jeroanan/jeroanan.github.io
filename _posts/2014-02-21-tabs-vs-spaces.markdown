One of the debates I've come across in my years of programming that might seem inane to non-coders is the question of whether code should be indented using spaces or tab characters. Should the coder hit the tab key once at the beginning of a new line, or hit the space bar a bunch of times?

What are the advantages of hitting tab? Some spring to mind:

<ul>
<li>Only one key stroke</li>
<li>The tab character's width can often be customised to the preference of the individual developer</li>
</ul>

Spaces:

<ul>
<li>It's mostly the same for everyone -- the layout of some code isn't likely to be trashed because of the differences between editors/user preferences</li>
<li>Because of that, we can make much smaller indents, which could aid readability</li>
</ul>

For me, the advantages of the tab character aren't really advantages at all. A lot of IDEs and editors can be configured to output a given number of space characters when the tab key is pressed. Giving the user the option to set in preferences how big indents appear to them doesn't seem to be much of an advantage to me either; it just seems like a way to have an inconsistent reading experience. Personally, I tend to go for 2-3 space characters per indent.
